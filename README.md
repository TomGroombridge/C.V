Experience
----------

In the Summer of 2012 I left school, I didn't know what I wanted to do, I ended up getting the opportunity to go and play semi-profesional hockey in Melbourne Australia for a year. Naturally I took the opportunity. When I was out there I found out about Web Development. I found <a href="http://yorkbutterfactory.com/"> York Butter Factory </a> in Melbourne and decided to hang around there and try and pick up any little jobs available. Naturally I had very little experiance so found it hard to get much interest. I decided to cut my trip short and fly back to London to enrol in <a href"http://www.makersacademy.com/">Makers Academy</a> where I developed the skills to start my career as a developer.
