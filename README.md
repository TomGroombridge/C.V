Experience
----------

Since ‘graduating’ from Makers Academy in February 2014 I have sought job opportunities to utilise and improve my coding skills. This is outlined below:


Founder & Developer, courseiam - LONDON: December - to date
  <a href="www.courseiam.com">courseiam.com</a>
Courseiam is an online administration, booking and marketing platform for people who run face to face courses. For example dress making, upholstery and cycling proficiency.
Decided to launch the programme having worked for a company operating a similar product in Melbourne, Australia.

Responsibilities:
  1. Forming the company.
  2. Designing the Platform and UX
  3. Coding the site from scratch
      The application was built in rails with html css and coffeescript.
  4.  Meeting with course providers to gain as much understanding to the road blocks in day to day running of their businesses.
  5. Pitching the product to potential clients.


full stack developer, playon - london/dublin: june- december 2014
<a href="www.playon.co">playon.co</a>
Playon is a online daily fantasy sports business which currently combines fantasy football and cricket with online gambling.
Worked as part of a team to help develop and expand the functionality and design of the site working mainly in frontend with html css and javascript as well as fixing bugs in ruby.

Responsibilities:
 Built the responsive site completely from scratch. This included working closely with a designer to create a good UX Design.
Worked alongside other developers to fix ruby bugs on a day to day basis. This included issues with player selection, injury and performance.
Invited to attend the Web Summit in Dublin to help promote and talk to potential Investors about our platform

Extra information:
This was my first freelance job and was given autonomy to solve problems given most members of the team worked remotely - even abroad.
It was my first opportunity to be involved with a major start up.


full stack Developer, fitzdares-London: april - june 2014
<a href="www.fitzdares.com">fitzdares.com</a>
Fitzdares is a bespoke gambling business based in Notting Hill, London.
Responsibilities:
Fixed bugs on the gambling system on a day to day basis as well as creating new betting options, for example Asian handicaps .
Built bespoke platforms for upcoming events such as the British Open and World Cup.
 Worked closely with Designers to integrate the designs created.
Created both front and back end including responsive design.
A lot of work would be in pair programming situations which allowed us to approach problems from a variety of directions and helped to speed up the learning process.Other Project
